    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>The context</h2>
        <p>As a candidate for president, Donald Trump denounced the United States’ trade,

            <q>“If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962”</q>, he said.
            
            Hence, the US-China trade war began in July 2018, leading to tariffs on some US$550 billion of Chinese goods and US$185 billion of US goods. Afterwards, the trade conflict seemed to escalate in the Fall of 2019 with new tariff increases, but at the end of 2019 the two countries agreed on a truce, cancelling some of the announced tariff increases and rolling back some of the earlier increases in tariffs. The truce led to the so-called Phase One Agreement signed in January 2020. 
            
        </p>
    <h2>Our objective</h2>
    <p>Indeed, since those two countries have such an influence on the world economy, we can assume that every single political tension related in the pres is susceptible to have some repercussions on assets.
    Thus,  we tried to analyze the US VS China trade war around the one million dollar question :
    What comes first : the price, or the sentiment?
    </p>
<p>We dived into other questions like : </p>
<ul>

<li>Is the stock market affected by quotations or the opposite?</li>
<li>Does the news only relate recent variations of the stock market when these variations have already been officially published?</li>
<li>Are we able to predict a specific stock market using sentiment analysis on newspaper quotes?</li>
<li>Is a daily frequency sufficient to capture correlation or causation between news and stock prices?</li>
<li>Can we quantify the time window within which a quote can influence the stock market ? (We suppose here that sentiment influence must vanish when time is passing).</li>
<li>What is the correlation between media quotations and stock prices behavior under a specific model?</li>
<li>What are good embedded features for stock prediction using NLP on quotations?</li>
<li>What kind of sentiment analysis features capture valuable information from quotes? Rule-based or embedding sentiment analysis ? TensorHub model (GloVe, fasttext, word2vec) ?</li>
<li>Are they red flags in quotes that are better predictors than sentiment analysis ?</li>
<li>Which assets are more affected by sentiment if applicable?</li>
<li>Are assets affected proportionally to the frequency they are mentioned in quotes ?</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Quotebank</h2>
            Quotebank dataset can be used to extract sentiment from its great amount of
                 quotes which cover the trade war period. We plan to use enhanced daily data about 
                 significant assets as our stock variation reference .
