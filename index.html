<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>The context</h3>
<p>As a candidate for president, Donald Trump denounced the United States’ trade,

    <q>“If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every
        lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section
        201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962”</q>, he said.

    Hence, the US-China trade war began in July 2018, leading to tariffs on some US$550 billion of Chinese goods and
    US$185 billion of US goods. Afterwards, the trade conflict seemed to escalate in the Fall of 2019 with new tariff
    increases, but at the end of 2019 the two countries agreed on a truce, cancelling some of the announced tariff
    increases and rolling back some of the earlier increases in tariffs. The truce led to the so-called Phase One
    Agreement signed in January 2020.

</p>
<h3>Our objective</h3>
<p>Indeed, since those two countries have such an influence on the world economy, we can assume that every single
    political tension related in the press is susceptible to have some repercussions on assets.
    Thus, we tried to analyze the US VS China trade war around the one million dollar question :
<p class="font-weight-bold text-center">What comes first : the price, or the sentiment?</p>
</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we dived into other questions : </p>
<ul>

    <li>Is the stock market affected by quotations or the opposite?</li>
    <li>Does the news only relate recent variations of the stock market when these variations have already been
        officially published?</li>
    <li>Are we able to predict a specific stock market using sentiment analysis on newspaper quotes?</li>
    <li>Can we quantify the time window within which a quote can influence the stock market ? (We suppose here that
        sentiment influence must vanish when time is passing).</li>
    <li>What is the correlation between media quotations and stock prices behavior under a specific model?</li>
    <li>What are good embedded features for stock prediction using NLP on quotations?</li>
    <li>What kind of sentiment analysis features capture valuable information from quotes? Rule-based or embedding
        sentiment analysis ? TensorHub model (GloVe, fasttext, word2vec) ?</li>
    <li>Are they red flags in quotes that are better predictors than sentiment analysis ?</li>
    <li>Which assets are more affected by sentiment if applicable?</li>
    <li>Are assets affected proportionally to the frequency they are mentioned in quotes ?</li>

</ul>

<h1>The data we used</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
Quotebank dataset can be used to extract sentiment from its great amount of
quotes which cover the trade war period. We plan to use enhanced daily data about
significant assets as our stock variation reference.
<br><br>
<h3>Stock Market </h3>
<p> <b> A stock market </b>is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions,
    not a physical facility or entity) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock" target="_blank">stocks</a> (also
    called shares),
    which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange" target="_blank"> stock exchange</a> , as
    well as stock that is only traded privately.
    
</p>
<p>
    To collect stock data we used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank">yfinance</a> python API. yfinance is a popular open source library developed by <a href = "https://aroussi.com/" target="_blank">Ran Aroussi</a>
     as a means to access the financial data available on Yahoo Finance.
</p>
<p>
    <a href = "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a> offers an excellent range of market data on stocks, bonds, currencies and cryptocurrencies. It also
    offers market news, reports and analysis and additionally options and fundamentals data- setting it apart from some
    of it’s competitors.
</p>
<p>  
   <u>Example:</u>  <br>
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks traded on  <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp" target ="_blank">the New York Stock Exchange</a> 
    (NYSE) and the <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp" target ="_blank">Nasdaq</a>.The DJIA was invented by Charles Dow in 1896.
</p>
<p>
    Often referred to as “the Dow,” the DJIA is one of the oldest, single most-watched indices in the world and includes
    companies such as the General Electric Company, the Walt Disney Company, Exxon Mobil Corporation and Microsoft
    Corporation. When the TV networks say <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketisup.asp" target = "_blank">“the market is up today”</a> , they are generally referring to the Dow.
    <br>
    <br>
    So with DJIA, we now have a reliable way to see how the market fared on a day. What we need now is a way to mine the
    public opinion, we turn to quoteBank.

Rate of return pricing is a method by which a company fixes the price of the product in such a way that it ultimately helps organisations in achieving the ultimate goal or return on the capital employed

"Closing price" generally refers to the last price at which a stock trades during a regular trading session. For many U.S. markets, regular trading sessions run from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
